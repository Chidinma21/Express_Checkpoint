        We need to future-proof this win-win-win. Great plan! Let me diarize
        this, and we can synchronize ourselves at a later timeframe, for
        strategic staircase wiggle room. Idea shower: what's our go to market
        strategy? Table the discussion; I just wanted to give you a heads-up,
        and run it up the flag pole for a performance review. It's a simple lift
        and shift job. Throughput criticality, pre-think our game-plan. So if
        you could do that, that would be great for critical mass. Pull in ten
        extra bodies to help roll the tortoise, a loss a day will keep you
        focused, then loop back. Back-end of third quarter, meeting assassins
        get buy-in to close the loop. When does this sun set?
